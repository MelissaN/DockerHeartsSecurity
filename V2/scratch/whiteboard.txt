6/3/18 - practice absolute positioning
	- absolute interface window
		- chat
		- canvas barrier
		- file drop zone ***
			- read filename and filecontents on backend
		- giant canvas auto scroll

/* 0. explanation */

- absolute interface window 
	- Interface: fixed size; always becomes the size of the screen
		- holds various window divs for important elements
			- Canvas: element within a fixed size interface-screen div
			- Chat: list element within a fixed size interface-chat div
			- File: on click, a scrollable window appears at mouseX, mouseY
- create a main div
	- canvas will add itself in sketch.js
- create a screen article div:
- create a chat aside div, with messages and input subdivs
	- could use flex, but will practice absolute positioning

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classes

All html wrapper classes contain the html object they control. 

Interface Class contains the interface div.
It creates children elements.
	- canvas div
	- chat div
	- chat_msg div (scrollable)
		- li in here
	- chat_input div
		- text input in here
It contains the socket for chat.
Inits some socket.on functions
Sends message on enter if text exists

Interface Class: will be a div
	uid:		to drop or collect files; to create appropriate file windows
	room:		to mark files
	health: 	may draw health bar - perhaps you get deleted when dead
	collection: array of file objects
	theme:		color or image background
	div: 		so color and theme is user-customizable
	height: 	automatic
	width:		automatic

	Div.addEventListener(show_file_window): uses mouseX mouseY
		show file window
			either read the file or show empty window
				*    - readonly
				**   - write
				***  - read and write
				**** - all cases
				read -  determine if file exists at mouse click; room global file array
				collect*
				drop**
				update***
				delete***
				close****


File Class: also a div. may be apart of Interface Class
	uid:
	text:
	x:
	y:
	room:
	div:
	img:
	show()
	hide()

Setup Script

Sketch? (will rename home.js in final version)

Every element is created and defined by this script. Their children created by this script. Their classes, buttons, and attached event handlers created by this script.

How to hide canvas?
	display of parent div
	or its own display 

home.js
	preload, setup, and draw run automatically.
		- when? I'm unsure.
		- assume after page load, after all js init.
	variable declarations for granular control.
		imperative variable initialization.
	algorithm.

Explanation:
	We want players to choose a name and alter ego, pick a room, recieve control of one character, chat, file click.

	home.js will contain the complete set of variables in the application. This includes all instances of html elements, all file, character, keyboard, and interface instances, and all function calls.

	sketch.js should just load images, append canvas, and draw the room list contained in home.js.

	could make a home class. that'd be pretty sexy. 
	I feel like that's how it ought to be written.

	---------------------------------------

Home class variables
	views 		= (home.main) view0(), view1(), view2()
	width 		= (home.main) window.width 
	height		= (home.main) window.height 
	logindiv	= (home.main) *in view*
	lobbydiv	= (home.main) *in view*
	roomdiv 	= (home.main) *in view*

	imgcube		= (home.main -> sketch.preload)
	canvas 		= (home.main -> sketch.setup)

	username	= (home.view0 -> home.view1)
	alterego	= (home.view0 -> home.view1)
	uid			= (home.view0 -> home.view1)

	socket		= (home.view0 -> home.view1)
	others		= (home.view0 -> home.view1)
	minimap		= (home.view0 -> home.view1)

	room 		= (home.view1 -> home.view2)
	character	= (home.view1 -> home.view2)
	keyboard	= (home.view1 -> home.view2)

	poisoned	= false (home.view2)

	initScreenSize()
	extractLogin()
	initUid()
	connect() // room and socket
	initCharacter() // keyboard and character
	updateOthers()
	deleteOthers()
	changeView()

	windowResized()

	LobbyButton.addEventListener(changeView)
	RoomButton.addEventListener(changeView)
	LogoutButton.addEventListener(changeView)

Navbar (logout button)

Views
	Login 
	Lobby
	Room

Login
	display only login div
		name:
		alterego: 

Lobby
	display only rooms div
		div of large clickable divs

Room
	display only interface div
		which contained the canvas and chat divs

Explanation:

	home object encapulates all other globals, it is also a global
		variables must change on resize
		allows all html elements to be globally alterable
		carries view objects 
			on resize, call the view objects' resize function

	There are three views.
	Each view links to the other two views through 
		buttons
			loginSubmit,				 logout button
			lobby subdivs (join  room),  logout button
			leave button  (leave room),  logout button

Variables:
	home instance variables

Algorithm main:
	main
		home
		views

	construct home object (pass document in)
	construct view objects (pass home in)
		they create a div with sizes based on window stats
		they popular it with appropriate children
			(login boxes) (Rooms) (canvas div, chat div)
		they control children's relative and absolute positions 
		they append their root divs to the document
	showView(0)
		

showView(x):
	this.hideViews();
	this.views[x]();

hideViews():
	for div of this.divs
		div.style.display = none;

view0: login
	this.divs[0].style.display = flex;

	shows login div
	shows two input boxes
	one named "username" other named "alterego"	

view0submit:
	// submit_button.addEventListener("view0Submit")

	on submit, we read from the input boxes

	if either of them is empty, return

	if both not empty, do
		uid
		username
		alterego
		socket
		others
		showView(1):
	
view1:
	gives you a view into each room
		minified versions of the sprites currently in them
		shrunk by ratio of div size / canvas size
	cluster lobby (bonus points)
		window views greatest cluster of people it can fit into view


		How to get a view into the room
	make multiple canvas's in p5.js
		Make one canvas that you partition into buffers: Graphics
		Draw the characters of each room on the appropriate buffer
			resize drawn images to appropriately scale buffer/window ratio

	variables
		canvas width, height
		lobbydiv width, height
		ldivs 1 - 6
			each one clickable 
				six clickable functions, or perhaps one closure


view2:
	// minimap - shows other players locations on the canvas

	this.divs[2].style.display = flex;


view class (home, left, top) 
	home
	left //offset from parent
	top
	div
	height
	width
	display()
	hide()
	init size()
	resize()

loginview class extends view
	constructor(home)
		appends user and alterego input boxes
		appends submitButton
		submitButton.addEventListener(submit)
	submit()
		set's homes variables (or returns)
		must hide this.div and view1.display()

lobbyview class extends view
	constructor(home)

Views

View Functions 

window.innerWidth;
window.innerHeight;




Room

Scrolling
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_element_scrollleft

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Functions

minimap(roomID, X, Y, W, H)
	draws mini map of size W x H on canvas at X, Y
	uses others dictionary + others list + roomID

	minimap buffer must be captured

-------------------------------------------------------
dropping and collecting files

soc.emit("drop", {text: text.value,
                  uid: homie.uid,
                  username: homie.username,
                  alterego: homie.alterego,
                  x:notepad.left,
                  y:notepad.y})
------------------------------------------------------
Talk Points

Front end with docker 
	- dealing with a lot of traffic
	- making clones of your website
	- clones of the database connection
	- each clone handles a set of users
		- but reloads from the same data source

Socket Technology 

Scaling 
	- Socket connections 
	- docker test feature (multiprocesses or docker service cluster)


	---------------------------------------------------

	Things To Do

	setup an alpine image / container
	on collect, run code inside container
		try to extract heart file
			determine if fail or successaAa
	reset container after every collect
--------------------------------------------------------
Docker Py notes

Manual: https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/containers.html

Example:
>>> import docker
>>> client = docker.from_env()
>>> client.containers.run('alpine', 'echo hello world')
b'hello world\n'

Parameters:
		image(str)
			alpine 
		command(str or list)
			string from user

		mem_limit(int) - limit mem usage
			100m
		remove
			true
		volumes(dict or list)
			{
				'./dockerland': 
					{'bind': '/dockerland', 'mode': 'rw'}
			}
		working_dir(str)
			/dockerland

Setup:
	Empty Volume ready on host
	Const variables to pass into container run
		mount hostpath and containerpath
		hostname, entrypoint, mem_limit, working_dir

Function Runtime:
	Put heart in volume
	run container with given string
	test for heart file, set deadalive boolean
	return output to socket, broadcast deadalive boolean

Frontend Runtime:
	Collect sets out a keydict
		uid 
		fileid
	backend updates character
		uid
		healthy or dead
	backend emits update character

	front end must draw character accordingly
		draw healthy character 1 way
		draw unhealthy character another way

	character class can have a health boolean
	character class returns img based on boolean
	character class has access to 2 img matricies
